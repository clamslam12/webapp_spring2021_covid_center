    <!--
        Inheritance rule: if a property is defined for an element, it is applied to all its children and descendants, unless explicitly changed.

        Not all, but some CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited by their child elements

        For example, if you set a color and font-family on an element, every element inside it will also be styled with that color and font, 
        unless you've applied different color and font values directly to them.

    <style>
        
        body {
            color: red;
            text-align: center;
            font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

        }

        p {
            color: blue;
        }


    </style>
    <body>
        <!--
            all elements except p and its children inherits body 
            CSS declarations, unless explicitly changed
        -->
        <h1>CSS Inheritance (h1)</h1>
        <h2>h2 element</h2>
        <p>Inheritance allows us to write more global styles on parent elements and 
            then "fine-tune" the styles for some of the <span style="color: green;">child elements</span> as needed. 
            Such approach makes writing CSS very efficient
        </p>
        <h2 style="color: orange;">another h2 element. color explicitly changed 
            so it does NOT inherit body color declaration, but it DOES inherit all other body declarations</h2>
        <p>another paragraph here is blue because of more fine-tuned rule for p elements.</p>
        <span>But this text here inherits color and all declarations from body</span>
