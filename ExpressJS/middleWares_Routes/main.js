//To assist in reading the body contents, you add express.json and express.urlencoded to your app instance to analyze incoming request bodies.

//Custom middleware

//This code defines a middleware function with an additional next argument.

//It logs the requestâ€™s path to your terminal console, and then calls the next function to continue the chain in the request-response cycle.
//From the time a request enters the server, it accesses a series of middleware functions.

//Depending on where you add your own custom middleware function, you can use next to let Express.js know that your function is complete and that you want to continue to whatever function is next in the chain.
