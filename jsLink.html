    <title>JS - embedded vs external link</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--
*******************************************************************************      
      The JavaScript code can be placed in:
        <script> tag in the head
        <script> tag in the end of body
        Usually the common practice since in this way HTML document will be rendered before JS codes are run by the browser.
*******************************************************************************
      JavaScript code is executed during the page loading or when the browser fires an event

        All statements are executed at page loading
        Some statements just define functions that can be called later
      Function calls or code can be attached as "event handlers" via tag attributes

      Executed when the event is fired by the browser
*******************************************************************************
      JavaScript codes are executed sequentially in the order encountered on the page.

      Functions are not executed until invoked.

      Assume the link to script1.js is placed in an HTML document before script2.js. Now, if script1.js defines a function myFunc, and scripts2.js defines a function with the same name, 
      then a call to myFunc executes the definition by scripts2.js.
